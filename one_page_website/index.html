    <h1> Grace Street: Caffeine & Sweets, What a Delight</h1>
    <h3 class = "purpletext"> Coffee, Lattes, Waffles, & Treats! College Student Study Playground!</h3>
    <p id = "bluetext">
      Grace Street is probably the best hipster joint to study with your friends
      while drinking lattes,<span style = "color:sienna"> coffee</span>,and eating absurdly sweet treats such as waffles
      as well. Located in the <span style = "color:palevioletred" >heart</span> of Koreatown, it is also a rather popular tourist
      spot as well! Inspired by Korean coffeehouses, Grace Street gives a more welcoming
      vibe during the day but a dessert parlor feel in the late hours of the night. Whether
      you are the early bird or the night owl, Grace Street is great for all types of
      college students whether they are coffee addicts or have a sweet tooth in general. Don't forget to
      leave the store without purchasing merch as shameless plugs for them while you use their
      tote bag on the street and you are paid nothing for advertising for them.
