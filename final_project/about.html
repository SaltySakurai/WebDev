    <p><img src="images/apo_nyu.png"> Alpha Phi Omega is a co-ed service fraternity established on December 16,1925 at Lafayette College dedicated to the principles of leadership, friendship, and service.
      It is the single most represented intercollegiate service organization in the United States. Derived from the principles of the Scout Oath and Law of the Boy Scouts of America,
      the national fraternity aims to provide opportunities for college students to develop leadership, friendship, and provide service to humanity.
      The Beta Iota Chapter of Alpha Phi Omega is located at New York University. It was founded in 1938 and rechartered in 1992. </p>
